# README

This is just a suuuuper basic blog app I made with Ruby on Rails as a part of The Odin Project. It allows the posting, editing, and deleting of basic articles if you're authenticated. Comments can be added to each article as well.

I was focused more on the back-end and making sure the different parts of the app work, rather than the CSS at this time. So the app itself looks really basic. I may update the UI at a later time to make things look nicer, but currently the back end all functions as it should.
